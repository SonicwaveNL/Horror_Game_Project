We are making an S\+F\+ML top-\/down horror game, where the user has to navigate their way through a maze, finding multiple \textquotesingle{}levers\textquotesingle{} and eventually opening the level\textquotesingle{}s door. ~\newline
 During this entire time, the user is being chased by a monster and the player\textquotesingle{}s view is limited, due to darkness, only having access to a flashlight. ~\newline
 The player can collect powerups, to make their journey easier. ~\newline
 The user can make their own levels as well.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{About the team}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
We are just a group of students, trying to finish a college project. ~\newline
 Striving to make a scary, exciting game to scare the hell out of our teachers.
