Horror Game Project
======
###### By Team Booh

# Information
## About this game
We are making an SFML top-down, rogue-like horror game, where the user has to navigate their way through a maze, finding multiple 'levers' and eventually opening the level's door.  
During this entire time, the user is being chased by a monster and the player's view is limited, due to darkness, only having access to a flashlight.  
The player can collect powerups, to make their journey easier.  
The user can make their own levels as well. 
    
## About the team

Striving to make a scary, exciting game to scare the hell out of our teachers.
